## ⚡ AUTOMATION LEVELS:

### LEVEL 1: Semi-Automated (Recommended for now)
**Your daily workflow:**
1. Paste trigger to Claude: `Execute daily blog workflow for Delvir`
2. Claude creates 10 posts + gives you Cursor prompt
3. Paste Cursor prompt (30 seconds)
4. Run git commands Claude provides (30 seconds)

**Total time:** 2 minutes per day for 10 blog posts

### LEVEL 2: Fully Automated (Requires Mac permissions)
If you grant Accessibility permissions to Terminal:
1. Paste trigger to Claude
2. Run ONE script Claude provides
3. Everything else is automatic

---

## 🛠️ SETUP (ONE-TIME):

### Enable Mac Automation (Optional but recommended):

**For full automation, enable these permissions:**

1. **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Add **Terminal** to the list
3. Add **Cursor** to the list

This allows scripts to control Cursor and push to GitHub automatically.
